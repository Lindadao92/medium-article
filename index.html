    <h2>Hogwarts Express</h2>
    <p>The Hogwarts Express departs from Platform 9Â¾ at Kingâ€™s Cross Station, which is in the arched wall between platforms 4
    and 5. If that seems short on magic, head towards the real-life entrance to platforms 9, 10 and 11 on the west side of
    the station. There youâ€™ll find a trolley disappearing into the magical realm through a wall with the sign: Platform 9Â¾.</p>

    <h2>St Pancras International</h2>
    <p>Next door to Kingâ€™s Cross Station is Londonâ€™s favourite Destination Station, St Pancras International. Outside youâ€™ll
    see the neo-gothic facade of St Pancras where the Weasleyâ€™s magical Ford Anglia takes off in Harry Potter and the
    Chamber of Secrets.</p>

    <h2>Reptile House</h2>
    <p>London Zooâ€™s Reptile House is where Harry first discovers his gift for talking with snakes in Harry Potter and the
    Philosopherâ€™s Stone. Home to more than 650 different species, youâ€™ll have the chance to chat to all sorts of weird and
    wonderful mammals, birds, invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians and fish on a visit to the zoo.</p>
